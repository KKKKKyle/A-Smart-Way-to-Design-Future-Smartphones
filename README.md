## Abstract
The mobile phone industry is one of the most innovative and rapidly developing field within Information and communications technology (ICT). Technical change and new product proliferation have made this industry extremely dynamic, even if market shares are highly concentrated in the hands of very few companies. To make profits and improve their competitiveness in the market, these manufacturers keep renewing their design of the mobile phones and launch new versions of smartphones frequently. However, most modern smartphones follow Apple’s iPhone design, which can generally be described as a large screen, a notch, and no headphone jack. In this project, we are going to design a smartphone appearance using deep learning techniques to see if these models can generate some surprisingly creative designs and break the ”traditional” design.
